# Comparing Cosmetics by Ingredients
This is an analysis of cosmetics using ingredients to show which cosmetic products are similar. First, the products have been limited to moisturizers and then limited to one skin type (dry skin). Then using t-SNE which is a dimensionality reduction technique specially for high dimensional datasets, products have been mapped using Bokeh. Products with similar ingredients are closer in the plot. This is a DataCamp project.
